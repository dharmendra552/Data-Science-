Creditcard Fraud Analysis :---



Credit card fraud happens when consumers give their credit card number to unfamiliar individuals, when cards are lost or stolen, when mail is diverted from the intended recipient and taken by criminals, or when employees of a business copy the cards or card numbers of a cardholder. In this notebook we will develop a few ML models using anonymized credit card transaction data. The challenge behind fraud detection is that frauds are far less common as compared to legal transactions.
On Analysizing on basis of dataset, we can find out about the percent of fraud that happens which are more sussceptable to the credit card frauds. 





The Methods / libraries used in this analysis are as below : 

EDA

sklearn 

Logistic Regression (with SMOTE as well as without SMOTE)

Random Forest Classifier with SMOTE

XGBoost

Neural Networks.
